Hi! My name is Philipp. I have a PhD in applied bioinformatics (2016), where I worked on new ways to genotype plant populations. I then got a Forrest Fellowship to work on wheat pangenomics and slowly started to move into machine learning to make sense of our large datasets. From there I moved into a ARC DECRA fellowship, from which I 'jumped ship' from academia into non-profits. I now work for the Minderoo Foundation in the OceanOmics team on pushing what is possible in the marine environmental eDNA space.

I have a longer CV on GitHub, [click here for the PDF](https://github.com/philippbayer/CV/blob/master/CV/CV_2pages_max.pdf).
