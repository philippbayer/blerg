description: i ramble about things scientists are supposed to know
---

I've realised that the general public doesn't really know what scientists do day-to-day - I didn't know either, as a BSc student. This is a loose listing of things scientists in various institutions are supposed to do, based on what I've been in contact with, or what I had to do. I don't think there exists a single scientist who is good at all of the below.

I'm hoping to use this as a starting point on how to think about what students are learning at university, and what I teach my PhD/MSc students - I assume all scientists had to self-teach most of this.

Note: This list was previously posted [on Github](https://github.com/philippbayer/Things-a-scientist-is-suppposed-to-know/). I'm consolidating my writing into one spot.

Second note: I am white, heterosexual male so there's a whole universe of things women, minorities, LGBT+, etc. have to learn in science that I am blind to.

Fourth note: I tried to thank everyone for their input including their academic title, please let me know if I got something wrong.

# The main thing

* How to teach yourself anything (thanks Prof. Anete Pereira de Souza/@anetepsouza!)

# Career planning

* How to know what you want to do in your career
* How to learn and plan about the different stages of your career
* How to find a mentor who can guide you through this, and how to work with that mentor
* How to find jobs/positions
* How to apply for jobs/positions
* How to make others create jobs/positions for you   
(Thanks Dr. Bastian Greshake/@gedankenstuecke for the three missed job hunt-related Hows!)

# Research

I think this section aligns well with what the public thinks of scientists.

* How to come up with novel or original research ideas
* How to plan the steps to answer the research questions
* How to finish research
* How to not get lost in the rabbit hole of possible research paths
* How to keep up with your field of research
* How to find your niche within your field of research (optional?)
* How to connect with support groups (Hacky Hours, Meetups, Carpentries Community etc.) (thanks Amanda Miotto/@amandamiotto!)
* How to innovate within your niche
* How to design a research lab room, and how to work with the design team for a new lab building (thanks Prof. Andrew Millar/@andrew7millar!)
* How to commission public art (who knew there's a size limit after which you need more permissions?!?) (thanks Prof. Andrew Millar/@andrew7millar!)
* How to manage and organise your time, esp. how to prioritise tasks and focus on only one (thanks Jobson Lucas Dias/@lucaspk!)


# Writing

All of the below require different formats, structures, and approaches.

* How to plan your paper
* Writing short reports for industry collaborators
* Writing book chapters
* Writing books
* Writing reviews
* Writing scientific papers
* Writing scientific papers for glam journals (requires a very different structure!)

# Plotting

All papers need accompanying plots to show data.

* Making plots for presentations (viewers can only see so much on a projector)
* Making plots for papers (readers can 'zoom in')
* Choosing good colour schemes
* Coming up with good plot designs
* Knowing how to plot in the chosen programming language (matlab, R, Python...)

# Presentations

Talking in public!

* How to predict the talk's audience, and how to adjust the level of the talk accordingly
* How to time your own talk
* How to reuse your own past slides to save time while still presenting novel content
* How to talk so that the back of the room still hears you

# Teaching

The regular, day-to-day university-level teaching of BSc, MSc students.

* How to take over someone else's course
* How to make your course fit into the university's teaching schedule
* How to outline your course
* How to keep your course up-to-date
* How to fight with the people who schedule your classes at 8am
* How to engage your students
* How to grade your students
* How to understand and evaluate your students
* How to apply what we know about the psychology of teaching in your course
* How to innovate - flipped classrooms etc. (thanks Dr. Adrian Paterson/@Darwinnernz!)

# Mentoring

I explicitly split this up from teaching as it's a completely different skill-set (IMHO).

* How to find good PhD, MSc students
* How to make sure that the people you found are actually good, or have the potential to be good
* How to come up with just the right project that fits with the peculiarities of a given student
* How to work with students' backgrounds - different cultures, different issues, mental health etc.

* How to spot early warning signs of student problems
* How to support your students
* How to engage or integrate your students in your group
* How to make sure your students finish on time
* How to keep in contact with your students after they finish
* How to write letters of recommendation/references for your past lab members (thanks Dr. Archa Fox/@AFox_Perth!)


# Communication skills

This section comes from Dr. David Eccles/@gringene_bio, slightly amended. Thank you!

# Publishing

A subset of politics...

* How to choose the right journal for your paper
* Optional - how to contact the editor before submission
* How to work with the editor
* How to interpret the reviewers' comments without feeling personally attacked (does anyone know?!?)

* How to deal with the university bureaucracy - reimbursements, travel authorization etc. pp. (thanks Asst Prof Rachel Schwartz/@rachelss!)

# Funding

* How to find funding opportunities
* How to learn about the 'tricks' each funding opportunity has (ex: In Australia, DECRAs are available 5 years post-PhD, with only 2 tries possible. So everybody applies in the last 2 years to have a track record as good as possible.)

# Self-care

I believe most scientists fail here. Including me.

* How to care for yourself
* How to maintain a work/life balance in face of how long this list here is
* How to recognise your own body's/psyche's warning signs

# 'Modern' science

Stuff that developed over the last 10, 20 years, and that most funding bodies (*in Australia*) do not particularly look for.

* How to do open science
* How to do reproducible science and its many subfields (version control, containers, etc. pp.)
* How to not stubbornly cling to one approach over all other possible approaches (thanks Dr. Sebastian Raschka/@rasbt!)


# The rest

* How to fix your parents' computer (thanks Dr. Pierre Lindenbaum/@yokofakun!)
* Where the best coffee is on campus (thanks Dr. Lee Hickey/@DrHikov!) along with their opening times


You can see, there's a *lot* a scientist is involved in. Far too much for one person; more on that another time.
